/* The following are the results of values passed in to the microsecond delay parameter of the
 * accelerometer sensor on the left, and the milliseconds between recorded events on the right.
 *
 * This was done on Pixel 6 (not 6a) running android 12, and then later 13.
 *
 * Sometimes the value would just snap back to 18 after starting at a different value, but if I used
 * developer functions to crash the background service and reopen the app, it would snap to whatever
 * the "correct" "allowed" value.  Baffling.
 *
 * This chunk of testing was done with the app open, plugged in.  Values with / means it varied a bit.
 *
 * "fastest" (0): 1 millisecond
 * 1000: 1
 * 2000: 2/3
 * 4000: 2/3
 * 3000: 2/3
 * 5000: 4 or 5
 * 6000: 4/5
 * 7000: 4/5
 * 8000: 4/5
 * 9000: 4/5
 * 9999: 9/10
 * 10000: 9/10
 * 15000: 9/10
 * 20000: 18
 * 30000: 18
 * 35000: 18
 * 40000: 36/37
 * 50000: 36/37, and then 18
 * 60000: 36/37, and then 18
 * 100000: 72
 * 150000: 72, and then 18
 * 200000: 145
 * 300000: 145
 * 400000: 145 and then 18
 * 500000: 145 and then 18
 * 600000: 145 and then 18
 *
 *
 *
 * other observations:
 * when the device screen turns off due to the screen timer it would step down to a lower value.
 * but I don't know what the value was, this test wos not intentional.
 *  the step was 145 milliseconds -> 288
 * I  tried 200000, it got stuck on 18 milliseconds and did not replicate the behavior.
 * I tried 300000 and it got stuck on 18 milliseconds for several minutes, then jumped to 145 BEFORE
 *  the device's screen turned off... then went BACK to 18 again still before the screen was off...
 *  then it went to 145 with the screen on, THEN the screen turned off, then it went back to 18.
 *    The only observation I can make in addition is that this switch would be ROUGHLY around when
 *    other timer events kicked off actions, like uploads or other sensors.  Its fairly reliable in
 *    this co-occurrence.  Maybe there is some kind of calculation where the system assigns more
 *    resources when these timers go off.  (it this case these were minutely timers.
 *      OKAY and it then EVENTUALLY like 10 minutes later started at 288... and then when there was
 *      another set of timer events that kicked it back up to 18.
 *      AFTER returning to the device about 45 minutes later it was still vacillating between these values.
 *
 * - I let a faster data rate, 4000, run for a while and it was fairly stable.
 *
 * - Using the dev tools to update the app with a custom value while the device has the screen off and
 *   was previously running at the lower, power-saving value would kick it up to the higher value.
 * - Accidentally unplugging the test device and plugging it back in a couple seconds later made
 *   no apparent change to the sampling rate.
